In this thesis, we study the risk of control-flow attack and how remote
attestation can help to detect the attack. We implement ScaRR control flow model
extractor. We can use the model to build an offline measurement database for
remote attestation to detect control flow attack. We present the design and the
implementation of the tool as two different LLVM passes. We verify the
scalability of the algorithm. We also discuss the limitation of the algorithm
and future works.
