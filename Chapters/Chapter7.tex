In this thesis, we study the risk of the control-flow attack and how remote
attestation can help detect the attack. We implement ScaRR control-flow model
extractor. We can use the model to build an offline measurement database for
remote attestation to detect control-flow attacks. We present the design and the
implementation of LLVM pass to extract the offline measurement. We verify the
scalability of the algorithm. We also discuss the limitation of the algorithm
and future works.
