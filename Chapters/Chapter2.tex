The main work of this research is to study the offline analysis of ScaRR's 
model~\cite{toffaliniScaRRScalableRuntime2019} over a set of programs written 
in C \textbackslash C++. 
Specifically, we write a tool to extract offline measurement using the ScaRR 
control-flow model, verify the scalability of the algorithm, and study its 
limitation.

To sum up, the main contributions of this thesis are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item propose an implementation of ScaRR's offline measurement extractor.
	\item verify the scalability of ScaRR's offline measurement algorithm.
	\item study the algorithm limitation.
\end{enumerate}
